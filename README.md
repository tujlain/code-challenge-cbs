# ðŸ’¼ CQRS + Event Sourcing Challenge: Withdraw from Account

Welcome to the coding challenge! This task is designed to evaluate your skills in software architecture, TypeScript, test-driven development, and code readability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Design and implement a simplified **CQRS + Event Sourcing** system that supports **withdrawing money from an account**.

This is a backend-only challengeâ€”**no UI or database integration** is required.

---

## âœ… Requirements

- Implement a simple event-sourced model using the **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.
- Focus on the **withdraw money** flow.
- Use **TypeScript**.
- Write **unit tests** to cover the main flow and edge cases (e.g., insufficient balance).
- In-memory data structures are sufficientâ€”**no persistence/database** is required.

---

## ðŸ“¦ What to Implement

### Domain

- `Account`
  - Has an `accountId`, `balance`.
  - Starts with an initial balance (e.g., 1000 units).
  
### Commands

- `WithdrawMoneyCommand`: Command to initiate a withdrawal.

### Events

- `MoneyWithdrawnEvent`: Emitted when money is successfully withdrawn.
- `InsufficientFundsEvent` *(optional)*: Emitted when withdrawal fails due to insufficient funds.

### Handlers

- **Command Handler**: Receives commands and validates business logic.
- **Event Store**: Stores emitted events in memory.
- **Event Handler / Projector**: Rebuilds the account state from past events.

### Queries

- A simple query to get the current account balance (reconstructed from events).

---

## ðŸ§ª Tests

Write unit tests to cover:

- Successful withdrawal.
- Multiple withdrawals.
- Withdrawal exceeding balance.
- Edge cases (e.g., negative withdrawal amounts).

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Language: **TypeScript**
- Testing Framework: **Jest** or any testing tool of your choice
- No frameworks required (no Nest.js, Express, etc.)
- No need for UI or REST APIsâ€”keep it simple and logic-focused.

---

## ðŸ§  Evaluation Criteria

- âœ… Clean architecture following CQRS and event sourcing principles.
- âœ… Code readability and naming conventions.
- âœ… Unit test coverage and thoughtful test cases.
- âœ… Use of TypeScript features and type safety.
- âœ… Thoughtful handling of edge cases.
- âœ… Simplicity and clarity over complexity.
